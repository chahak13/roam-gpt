#+title: autoreload with ipython
Ref: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html

Start =autoreload= with =ipython= to automatically reload imported modules. This makes working in =ipython= while changing source code easier as you don't have to restart kernels every time or reload using =importlib= everytime there is a change in the source code.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
#+end_src

This method has its caveats and should be used carefully.
