#+title: Org mode customize latex export

Various options can be used to customize the latex output of org mode exported
file. Some useful snippets from the documentation are given below.

#+begin_quote
‘DESCRIPTION’
     The document’s description.  The description along with author
     name, keywords, and related file metadata are inserted in the
     output file by the hyperref package.  See
     ‘org-latex-hyperref-template’ for customizing metadata items.  See
     ‘org-latex-title-command’ for typesetting description into the
     document’s front matter.  Use multiple ‘DESCRIPTION’ keywords for
     long descriptions.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
‘LATEX_CLASS’
     This is LaTeX document class, such as _article_, _report_, _book_,
     and so on, which contain predefined preamble and headline level
     mapping that the LaTeX export back-end needs.  The back-end reads
     the default class name from the ‘org-latex-default-class’ variable.
     Org has _article_ as the default class.  A valid default class must
     be an element of ‘org-latex-classes’.

‘LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS’
     Options the LaTeX export back-end uses when calling the LaTeX
     document class.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
‘LATEX_HEADER’
‘LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA’
     Arbitrary lines to add to the document’s preamble, before the
     hyperref settings.  See ‘org-latex-classes’ for adjusting the
     structure and order of the LaTeX headers.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
‘SUBTITLE’
     The document’s subtitle.  It is typeset as per
     ‘org-latex-subtitle-format’.  If ‘org-latex-subtitle-separate’ is
     non-‘nil’, it is typed outside of the ‘\title’ macro.  See
     ‘org-latex-hyperref-template’ for customizing metadata items.  See
     ‘org-latex-title-command’ for typesetting description into the
     document’s front matter.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
To float an image without specifying a caption, set the
‘:float’ attribute to one of the following:

‘t’
     For a standard ‘figure’ environment; used by default whenever an
     image has a caption.

‘multicolumn’
     To span the image across multiple columns of a page; the back-end
     wraps the image in a ‘figure*’ environment.

‘wrap’
     For text to flow around the image on the right; the figure occupies
     the left half of the page.

‘sideways’
     For a new page with the image sideways, rotated ninety degrees, in
     a ‘sidewaysfigure’ environment; overrides ‘:placement’ setting.

‘nil’
     To avoid a ‘:float’ even if using a caption.

13.10.10 Special blocks in LaTeX export
---------------------------------------

For other special blocks in the Org file, the LaTeX export back-end
makes a special environment of the same name.  The back-end also takes
‘:options’, if any, and appends as-is to that environment’s opening
string.  For example:

     #+BEGIN_abstract
       We demonstrate how to solve the Syracuse problem.
     #+END_abstract

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Proof of important theorem]
     #+BEGIN_proof
       ...
       Therefore, any even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
     #+END_proof

exports to

     \begin{abstract}
       We demonstrate how to solve the Syracuse problem.
     \end{abstract}

     \begin{proof}[Proof of important theorem]
       ...
       Therefore, any even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
     \end{proof}

   If you need to insert a specific caption command, use ‘:caption’
attribute.  It overrides standard ‘CAPTION’ value, if any.  For example:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \MyCaption{HeadingA}
     #+BEGIN_proof
       ...
     #+END_proof
