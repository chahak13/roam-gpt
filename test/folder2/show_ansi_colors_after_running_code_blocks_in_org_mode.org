#+title: Show ANSI colors after running code blocks in org mode

If there are any errors on running a code block in org-mode with ansi colors, they get displayed as the color codes. Adding this function as a hook to org-mode resolves that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun display-ansi-colors ()
  (ansi-color-apply-on-region (point-min) (point-max)))

(add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook #'display-ansi-colors)
#+end_src
