* Data Science
** Draft 1
Dear Hiring Manager,
#+begin_export latex
\vspace{2em}
#+end_export

I have spent the past several years in learning about computer programming and machine learning. What started out as a hobby is something that I've made into a full-time work for myself and I'm excited to bring my expertise as an intern at LightBox.


I have experience in developing machine learning pipelines and working with the software engineering team in integrating a machine learning model into the entire product. I worked at Housing.com as a Data Scientist where I helped implement a new price prediction model from scratch, which lead to an increase in the rental sales because of the highly accurate model (~90% accuracy). Working there as a bridge between the Data Science team and the Back-end team also allowed me to understand intrinsicly the various steps that are required to efficiently integrate ML models into an ecosystem. I also have strong communication skills and experience in explaining technical topics to a general audience because of my experience.


For the past 1.5 years, I have been working on a project at University of Texas (Austin) where we are developing a new way of simulating epidemics on a large scale. I am collaborating with teams in University of Sonora, Mexico and Mathematics Research Center, Mexico and this has made me comfortable in collaborating with people in different time zones remotely and efficiently in these times of a pandemic. With my background, experience, and drive to learn things that I don't know, I'm sure I can be an asset to the Data Science team at LightBox.


I have attached my resume for your reference. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon.
