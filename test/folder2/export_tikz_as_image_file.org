#+title: Export tikz as image file

* [[https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/275023/export-tikz-as-image-file][Export tikz as image file]]

I have created a tikz picture as a standalone.
Can I export the tex file as an image instead of as a pdf?

+ (/Johannes_B/) No, but you can easily convert the pdf to jpg or png.
+ (/Arun Debray/) A couple possible solutions are discussed in tex.stackexchange.com/a/11880/55879.
+ (/user11232/) standalone provides convert option. For this you will need imagemagick installed.
+ (/user11232/) Or you can directly convert it using imagemagick â†’ convert -density 300 yourfile.pdf yourfile.png (or .jpg whatever)
+ (/vaettchen/) QTikZ is a nice editor cum preview pane and offers export to PNG
** Answer 1

I achieved the best results with ~pdftoppm~, the anti-aliasing is much better than imagemagicks ~convert~.
Just do:
#+begin_example 
$ pdftoppm -png -r <dpi> document.pdf > document.png

#+end_example
I usually use 300 or 600 dpi.
~pdftoppm~ comes with ~poppler~ (package ~poppler-utils~ on Ubuntu).

** Answer 2

If you are using Texmaker, right-click on the pdf, then choose ~convert page to png image~ choice. *Note:* if you intend to include this image in your tex file, then you can include the pdf directly. As a matter of fact, the quality of the pdf is better than converting the pdf to an image.
