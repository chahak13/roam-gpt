#+title: emacs-jupyter with different venvs in same directory

Because of my setup, whenever I open an org buffer in the blog's directory and start a jupyter REPL in it, it uses the =direnv= package with emacs and =pipenv= to activate the virtual env corresponding to the blog. Now, if for some reason I want the repl to connect to a venv from a different directory/project (ex. matplotlib), this can be done by first starting a kernel in that directory in a shell using the following command:

#+begin_example shell
jupyter kernel
#+end_example

and then using the kernel file (location given in the output of the above command) as the value for the =:session= header arg in the org file.
