* SEIRS model

They use a standard SEIRS Model with mobility from different patches added.
* Well posedness of model
It is fairly easy to show the well posedness of the model by showing the non-decreasing nature of the ODE of the system. The upper bound is shown by summing all equations for S, E, I and R, and showing that dN/dt \le 0 if N = A/d.
