- Short talk by Alfred Zanini, a journalist and documentary filmmaker based in Hong Kong.
- Talk about workflows
- What is a workflow?
  + Any sequnce of actions or tools to achieve a broader task.
- Good way to start improving workflows is to actually make a conscious effort to figure out /what/ are my regular workflows and write those down.
- Maybe creating a flowchart will make it easier to understand what all things are required in a workflow.
- If literate programming using org is a serious thought, then I need to study up and use the /noweb syntax/ properly as it allows me to not have to follow the same structure that my tangled code file would have.
- Don't do everything all at once. Change one part of your workflow and get comfortable with that change before changing something else.
