1. Pipewire installation


Taking a leap into understanding a little more about Pipewire since
pulseaudio is being a pain and my mic is not working on my archlinux
system either.

+ Soundcard is the DAC to convert analog sound to digital (and
  vice-versa)
+ Soundcards also include other hardware for amplifiers etc.
+ Kernel has a driver that will allow interaction with the sound card
+ OSS (Open sound system) was the first sound driver.
+ OSS is now replaced by ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture).
+ ALSA provides the required drivers to interact with different forms of
  devices (mic, headphone, speaker etc.)
+ ALSA doesn’t allow multiple inputs to one output (multiplexing)
+ Program (client) -> Pulseaudio (server) -> ALSA (driver) -> sound card
+ This moves the responsibility of sampling and mixing from ALSA or the
  card to the /server/.
+ The server can also take in multiple inputs from the microphone and
  push that into multiple programs (outputs)
+ JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) is also a sound server that works
  better with pro-audio tools.
+ JACK is more flexible than pulseaudio but is a bit more difficult to
  use. /(as if pulseaudio is easy to troubleshoot…)/
+ JACK also has much smaller latencies.
+ Pipewire - hopefully the ultimate replacement of both Pulseaudio and
  JACK.
+ Pipewire works as a drop-in replacement for Pulseaudio /and/ JACK.
+ Pipewire needs the session plumber (wireplumber) to actually route
  audio to devices.
+ `streambay' is a Pipewire graph GUI interface.


1 Pipewire installation
═══════════════════════

  ⁃ Install the following:
    • `pipewire'
    • `pipewire-docs' for documentation
    • `wireplumber' for pipewire session management
    • `wireplumber-docs' for wireplumber documentation
    • `qpwgraph' for Pipewire Patchbay
    • `pipewire-alsa' to route all applications using ALSA through
      pipewire (and remove `pulseaudio-alsa' if installed)
    • `pipewire-pulse' to replace `pulseaudio' and
      `pulseaudio-bluetooth'
    • `pipewire-jack' for JACK support
  ⁃ Playing anything after installation should just work. `qpwgraph' can
    be used to visualize the sources and sinks.

  ⁃ Audio playback works after reboot too, without any extra
    configuration.
  ⁃ To check the microphone, first test on <https://mictests.com>
    ⁃ Mic still doesn’t seem to be working.
    ⁃ Checking the graph, when firefox tries to record, the capture
      device is connected to the `Tiger Lake-H HD Audio Controller
      (Microphone (*))' device which I would assume to be the right one.
      It is also labelled as a capture device so that tracks too.
